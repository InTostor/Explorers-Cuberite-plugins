Since ZBS is a universal Lua IDE, you need to first set it up so that it is ready for Cuberite plugin development. For that, you need to download one file, cuberite.lua from the ZBS's plugin repository. Place that file in the "packages" folder inside your ZBS's folder. Note that there are other useful plugins in the repository and you may want to have a look there later on to further customize your ZBS. To install them, simply save them into the same folder.

Next you should install the code-completion support specific for Cuberite. You should repeat this step from time to time, because the API evolves in time so new functions and classes are added to it quite often. You should have an APIDump plugin in your Cuberite installation. Enable the APIDump plugin in the server settings, it's very cheap to keep it enabled and it doesn't cost any performance during normal gameplay. To generate the code-completion support file, enter the api command into the server console. This will create a new file, "cuberite_api.lua", next to the Cuberite executable. Move that file into the "api/lua" subfolder inside your ZBS's folder. (Note that if you had the "mcserver_api.lua" file from previous versions, you should remove it)

After you download the cuberite.lua file and install the completion support, you need to restart ZBS in order for the plugin to load. If there are no errors, you should see two new items in the Project -> Lua Interpreter submenu: "Cuberite - debug mode" and "Cuberite - release mode". The only difference between the two is which filename they use to launch Cuberite - cuberite_debug(.exe) for the debug option and "cuberite(.exe)" for the release option. If you built your own Cuberite executable and you built it in debug mode, you should select the debug mode option. In all other cases, including if you downloaded the already-compiled Cuberite executable from the internet, you should select the release mode option.

For a first time user, it might be a bit overwhelming that there are no GUI settings in the ZBS, yet the IDE is very configurable. There are two files that you edit in order to change settings, either system-wide (all users of the computer share those settings) or user-wide (the settings are only for a specific user of the computer). Those files are regular Lua sources and you can quickly locate them and edit them from within the IDE itself, select Edit -> Preferences -> Settings: XYZ from the menu, with XYZ being either System or User.

There is a documentation on most of the settings on ZBS's webpage, have a look at https://studio.zerobrane.com/documentation.html, especially the Preferences section. Personally I recommend setting editor.usetabs to true and possibly adjusting the editor.tabwidth, turn off the editor.smartindent feature and for debugging the option debugger.alloweditting should be set to true unless you feel like punishing yourself.
